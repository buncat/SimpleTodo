## Notes

Some challenges I faced with this app had to do with bugs and following along with the video. I needed to do more research to help me solve some of the issues (it wouldn't run on  the simulator), but I was finally able to get it  work with some help from my peers. I still hope to do more for it in the future. I hope to implement an app icon (still working on it) for it, as well. Then, I will have a name to match. Thank you.
